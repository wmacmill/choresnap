This plugin extends WooCommerce by setting sequential order numbers for new orders.

== Description ==

This plugin extends WooCommerce by automatically setting sequential order numbers for new orders.  If there are existing orders at the time of installation, the sequential order numbers will start with the highest current order number.

**This plugin requires WooCommerce 2.1 or newer.**

> No configuration needed! The plugin is so easy to use, there aren't even any settings. Activate it, and orders will automatically become sequential.

If you like this plugin, but are looking for the ability to set the starting number, or to add a custom prefix/suffix to your order numbers (ie, you'd prefer something like WT101UK, WT102UK, etc) please consider our premium WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers Pro plugin, which is available in the [WooThemes Store](http://www.woothemes.com/products/sequential-order-numbers-pro/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the settings? =

The plugin doesn't require any :). When you activate it, it gets to work right away! Orders will automatically become sequential, starting from the most recent order number.

= Can I start the order numbers at a particular number? =

This free version does not have that functionality, but the premium [WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers Pro](http://www.woothemes.com/products/sequential-order-numbers-pro/) will allow you to choose any starting number that's higher than your most current order number.

= Can I set an order number prefix/suffix? =

This free version does not have that functionality, but it's included in the premium [WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers Pro](http://www.woothemes.com/products/sequential-order-numbers-pro/).
