"<strong>Format</strong> - Post Formats designate how your theme will display "
"a specific post. For example, you could have a <em>standard</em> blog post "
"with a title and paragraphs, or a short <em>aside</em> that omits the title "
"and contains a short text blurb. Please refer to the Codex for <a href="
"\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats#Supported_Formats\">descriptions "
"of each post format</a>. Your theme could enable all or some of 10 possible "
"formats."
